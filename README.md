# Overview
This project aims to perform an in-depth data analysis on a professional-grade movie dataset to uncover meaningful insights into movie ratings, revenue trends, genre popularity, and audience preferences. Leveraging The Movies Dataset from Kaggle, which aggregates data from The Movie Database (TMDb), this analysis integrates multiple data sources, including metadata, user ratings, and financial metrics like budget and revenue.

The primary goal is to explore relationships between various movie features such as genre, runtime, popularity, budget, and release date also their influence on audience ratings and box office performance. Additionally, the project examines long-term trends across the film industry and highlights key characteristics of top-performing movies.
